This part requires a bit more information but it's similar to adding a social media page like you did above but with more information.  The first item you enter is last year you worked at the job (or the range of time, if you prefer).  The second item is your job title, the third is the company you worked for, and the fourth is a description of the work you did there.  The description can get a little long, but that's okay.  Just be sure not to use any single quotes ('') or things will break!  You can add as many jobs as you like and the script will adapt.

// Finally, let's list any awards or honors you've received so you can show off your accomplishments.  To add an award, just use the format below.  (I'm sure you have the hang of this by now, but we're going to go over it anyway.)  The first item you enter is the name of the award/honor (e.g. "Advertising Gold Award" or "Published in the New Yorker") and the second item is the description of the award/honor (e.g. "2010 TV Ads Under $50,000" or "Short story about the trials of Orthodox Jews in Arkansas, May 2016").
